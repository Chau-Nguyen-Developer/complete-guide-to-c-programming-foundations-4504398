/* Recap:
1. the starting point for all C programs is the main() function.
2. The semicolon shows up at the end of each statement. Not at the end of a function or preprocessor directives.
3. Functions, operators, and keywords are part of C language. "Methods" are not part of C language.
The C language is procedural and uses functions. Methods are associated with object-oriented languages.
4. Nested comments are not allowed.
5. The standard C functions dwell (aka stays at) the library. 
The library contains the routines that make the standard C functions work for a specific hardware platform. 
They not reside in the linker or compiler or header files. 
6. What does the #include preprocessor directive typically do?
--> Bring in a header file to help with the definitions used by various functions. 
Header files are used by functions to help define various function features. 
The prepocessor does not direct the OS to start running code at a specific location or adds the proper C library into your code
or adds the stdio.h file into the code to assist with compiling. 
7. A program can build with warnings, but not for error.
